# travelme

travel me is a blogging application with the goal to simplify logging a journey for travellers. Through the flat design web interface the user is able to add trips to anywhere in the world. Within each trip they can add posts logging thier adventure as it happens. Each post has the potential to store location data, this means the location of the user can be mapped onto a mapping application and viewed. 

This project has allowed me to develop my understanding of the following:
